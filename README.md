# Description 
The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.
   As a developer 
   I want to create notes of code snippets with or without an internet connection

   so that i can reliably retrieve them for late use
